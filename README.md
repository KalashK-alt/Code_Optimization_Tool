This project is a Python-based desktop application designed to analyze and optimize Python source code. It performs static code analysis techniques such as:

 Dead Code Elimination

 Code Clone Detection

 Loop Invariant Optimization

In addition, the tool measures execution time and memory usage before and after optimization, providing graphical comparisons and Excel-based performance reporting.

The application integrates static optimization techniques with dynamic benchmarking in a user-friendly GUI built using Tkinter.
